# QtMusicPlayer
QtMusicPlayer is an app written in C++ Qt, it's not one of the best apps you will find out here but it's mine and I want to learn C++ Qt by making various projects and making a lot of my ideas
happen. There may be some bugs too, if you find one, please notify me or fix them if you want and you know how to do it.

# Installation
Soon...

# Compatibility 
It will run on Linux for sure, but I don't know how about windows. I've never tested it on windows. Bugs may occur.
